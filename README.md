For many non-professional traders and investors who wish to manage an investment portfolio for the purpose of personal finance, it is difficult, time-consuming, and unreasonable to do so alone. With digital technology becoming increasingly widespread, many brokerage accounts have realeased application programming interfaces through which clients may manage a portfolio using software stored on their local device. Additionally, while most APIs used to be limited to large, institutional investors, individual clients can now utilize some APIs without a minimum net worth or investment requirement. This is an obvious alternative to managing a portfolio by hand. Rather than needing to manually look at charts, news, and statistics and then place trades while many investors are busy with work or school, a program can collect data in real-time, make decisions based on that data, and execute trades without constant intervention from a human. This is exactly the purpose of this program, which currently utilizes relatively simple algorithms and will eventually use machine learning to accurately predict price changes and act upon them for any security.

This program utilizes the Interactive Brokers Trader Workstation API to automate trades and the Twelve Data API to receive realtime stock data. In this use case, Twelve Data is advantageous to receiving market data via Interactive Brokers due to lower costs and simplified programming.
